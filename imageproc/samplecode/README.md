# eoh23
The repo for OSAI's EOH'23 exhibit.

This project uses OpenCV, MatPlotLib, NumPy and TensorFlow to create a few computer vision tools - that apply filters to video-frames captured in real-time

## Different prongs of the project
1. Image filters (similar to Instagram/Snapchat filters)
2. ML (object detection, face detection, etc.), transfering this to accessible tools

### Image filters
1. Replace user's eyes with the illini I logo
2. Easter bunny ears
3. Drawing with your nose
4. Iron man hands
5. Spiderman web shooter

**Possible filters:**
1. Cartoonify the user's face (trace detection, color quantization, and contour tracing)
2. Replace user's background with a different image
3. (ML) emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, etc.) and apply a filter based on that
4. Recording the user + filter and saving it to a file

### ML (accessibility tools)
1. Eyeball tracking for moving the cursor
2. Blinking to click
3. Lip tracking to type (or switch filters)
